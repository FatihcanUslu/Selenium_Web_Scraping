Cappeau, a wine merchant and poet, had been asked by a parish priest to write a Christmas poem. Unitarian minister John Sullivan Dwight, editor of Dwight's Journal of Music, created a singing edition based on Cappeau's French text in 1855. In both the French original and in the two familiar English versions of the carol, the text reflects on the birth of Jesus and of humanity's redemption.\n\nLyrics\nO Holy Night!

Before him lowly bend!\nBehold your King! Before him lowly bend!\n\nTruly He taught us to love one another,\nHis law is love and His gospel is peace.\nChains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.\nAnd in his name all oppression shall cease.\nSweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,\nWith all our hearts we praise His holy name.\nChrist is the Lord!

He went on to write some of the most important masterpieces of the Classical era, including symphonies, operas, string quartets and piano music.Composed:1787Info:This was Mozart's composition for a chamber ensemble (a string quartet with an added double-bass). It is probably one of his most popular pieces. Oddly enough, Mozart never published 'Eine Kleine Nachtmusik' in his lifetime. It was left up to his widow, Constanze, to sell it in a job lot of his music to a publisher in 1799, presumably to raise much needed cash. It saw public light of day only in 1827, some forty years after it was written.Score Type:Beginner Arrangement for Piano soloScore Key:C major (Sounding Pitch) (View more C major Music for Piano )Tempo Marking:Time Signature:4/4 (View more 4/4 Music)Duration:1:26Number of Pages:2Difficulty:Beginners Level: Recommended for BeginnersInstrument:  (View more Beginners Music)Style:Classical (View more Classical Music)Tags: classical    beginner piano    18th century    beginners  Copyright:\u00a9 Copyright 2000-2022 Red Balloon Technology Ltd (8notes.com)\n ", "Beginners Level"]]
